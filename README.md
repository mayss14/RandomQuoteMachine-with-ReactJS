# Random Quote Machine with ReactJS

Welcome to the Random Quote Machine, a simple web application built with React! 
This project was a great starting point for me when I was looking to learn and practice my React skills. 
It provides a fun way to display and generate random quotes at the click of a button.
Below, I'll provide  a video showing the app
